More than 70 percent of Nigeria’s population is made up of young people, with estimations of continuous growth in the next few decades. Given this significant number, it is evident that the future growth of Nigeria is linked to having an educated, skilled, healthy, and politically active youthful population that is involved in the development of long-term policy strategies. <br> <br>

The participation of Nigerian youth in leadership and politics has evolved overtime. Coming from a legacy of active student unionism (1980s), where universities served as spaces for intellectual debates and youth expression, to a period of youth organizing aided by new media (2010-present), the Nigerian youth ecosystem has experienced a reawakening of some sorts. <br> <br>

The #NotTooYoungToRun campaign (2016- 2018) and the noticeable increase in youth agitation and awareness of socio-economic and political indices in Nigeria are symbolic representations of the increasing leadership capabilities of young Nigerians. <br> <br>

Given a myriad of social challenges and policy failures that young Nigerians contend with, they have become increasingly poised to lead powerful organizations, institutions and groups, having built capacity from leading change at a social level. The African Leadership Institute report, “An Abundance of Young African Leaders but No Seat at the Table,” points out that Africa does not suffer a lack of young leaders However, many young Africans lack representation in the corridors of power. According to the report, about 700,000 young Africans have already been exposed to a level of selective leadership initiative, implying that the challenge is in harnessing the innovation, creativity and potential of these young leaders. <br> <br>

As witnessed in recent youth agitations and protests, it is evident that young Nigerians are already exploring alternative leadership and funding models aided by digital technology. <br>
<br>

However, some of these agitations have made evident some leadership, sustainability and organizational gaps within the Nigerian youth ecosystem. Noticeable among them are weak negotiation and consensus-building methods, unclear exit strategy, inability to identify intergenerational allies, and a limited capacity to facilitate long-term engagement with existing governance or political structures. In addition, efforts by stakeholders in the Nigerian youth ecosystem are still compromised by a preference to work in silos, leading to a duplication of efforts and unsustainable results. <br> <br>

Consequently, LEAP Africa in partnership with MacArthur Foundation and Ford Foundation sought to establish the Nigeria Youth Futures fund (NYFF) to provide targeted capacity building, youth ecosystem building and financial support to burgeoning youth-led movements in Nigeria, in order to sustain their work locally and facilitate opportunities for learning. <br>
